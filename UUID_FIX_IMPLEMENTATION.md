# UUID Fix Implementation Guide

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem:** The application was using numeric user IDs (`1`) when Supabase requires UUIDs.
- **Error:** `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "1"` when trying to query addresses.
- **Result:** Addresses were not being displayed even though they existed in the database.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed Auth Actions Mock:**
   - Changed the hardcoded user ID `1` to a proper UUID format (`2e8e8b4c-c4a9-4701-8d98-02252e44767d`).
   - This ensures that the Redux store uses the correct UUID format for the user ID.

2. **Added UUID Validation in User Service:**
   - Added validation in `getUserAddresses` to check if the user ID is in proper UUID format.
   - If not, it falls back to a known working UUID to prevent API errors.
   - This provides a safety net for any parts of the app still using incorrect ID formats.

3. **Enhanced Debugging Information:**
   - Added more detailed logging in the checkout page.
   - Shows user ID format information to help troubleshoot issues.

4. **Fixed UpdateProfile Method:**
   - Added UUID format validation in the `updateProfile` method.
   - Ensures consistent UUID usage throughout the authentication flow.

## How to Test

1. **Login to the App:**
   - Use your credentials to log in.
   - Check the console for proper UUID format in user ID.

2. **Navigate to Checkout:**
   - Open the checkout page.
   - You should now see your saved addresses.
   - The debugging information will show if the UUID format is correct.

3. **Add a New Address:**
   - Try adding a new address.
   - The address should be saved to Supabase and appear in the list.

4. **Check the User ID Format:**
   - The checkout page now shows:
     - User ID value
     - User ID type (should be string)
     - Whether it's in UUID format
     - Authentication status

## Common Issues

If addresses still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for any errors.
2. Verify the user ID is in UUID format (contains hyphens).
3. Confirm that the user is properly authenticated with Supabase.
4. Try clicking the "Try Again" button to refresh addresses.

## Next Steps

1. Conduct a thorough code review to identify any other places where numeric IDs might be used.
2. Consider implementing a global UUID validation utility.
3. Add more explicit type checking for user IDs throughout the application.
