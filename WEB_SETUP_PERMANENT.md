# React Native Web Setup - Permanent Solution

This project has been configured with **permanent web-stubs** that will work for everyone who clones the repository.

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

1. **Redux Error**: Fixed duplicate action reducer in `adminSlice.ts`
2. **React Native Module Resolution**: Created permanent web-stubs in `/web-stubs/` directory
3. **Metro Configuration**: Updated `metro.config.js` to use permanent stubs

## 🔧 **Permanent Web-Stubs Created:**

- ✅ Platform module
- ✅ PlatformColorValueTypes
- ✅ BaseViewConfig  
- ✅ legacySendAccessibilityEvent
- ✅ ReactDevToolsSettingsManager
- ✅ RCTAlertManager
- ✅ RCTNetworking
- ✅ BackHandler
- ✅ Image component

## 🚀 **How to Run:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npx expo start

# For web only
npx expo start --web

# If network issues, use offline mode
npx expo start --offline
```

## 📁 **Project Structure:**

```
├── web-stubs/                          # Permanent web compatibility stubs
│   ├── react-native/

├── metro.config.js                     # Updated with permanent aliases
└── app/store/slices/adminSlice.ts      # Fixed Redux duplicate actions
```

## 🔄 **Why This Solution is Permanent:**

1. **Version Controlled**: All stubs are in `/web-stubs/` and tracked in git
2. **No node_modules Changes**: Nothing modified in `node_modules/`
3. **Team Ready**: Anyone cloning the repo gets the fixes automatically
4. **npm install Safe**: Fixes persist through dependency reinstalls

## 🌐 **Web Compatibility:**

The app now runs on web platform with proper implementations for:
- Platform detection (detects 'web' correctly)
- Image handling (uses HTML `<img>` tags)
- Network requests (uses fetch API)
- Alert dialogs (uses browser alert/confirm)
- Back button handling (uses browser history)
- Accessibility events (uses custom events)

## 🛠️ **For Developers:**

When you clone this repository:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npx expo start --web`
3. Everything works out of the box! 

No additional setup or manual fixes needed.

## ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- The Redux error has been permanently fixed
- All React Native core modules have web-compatible stubs
- Metro bundler is configured to use these stubs automatically
- The solution works for both development and production builds
