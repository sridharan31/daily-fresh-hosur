## Current Structure

The application now follows a clean architecture pattern with Supabase:

```
lib/
  supabase/
    client.ts                 # Supabase client configuration
    store/                    # Redux store for Supabase
      actions/                # Redux actions
        authActions.ts        # Auth actions
        productActions.ts     # Product actions
        cartActions.ts        # Cart actions
        orderActions.ts       # Order actions
      authSlice.ts            # Auth state management
      productSlice.ts         # Product state management
      cartSlice.ts            # Cart state management
      orderSlice.ts           # Order state management
      rootReducer.ts          # Root reducer
      index.ts                # Store configuration
  supabase/
    client.ts              # Supabase client configuration
    store/                 # Redux store for Supabase
      actions/             # Redux actions
        authActions.ts     # Auth actions
        productActions.ts  # Product actions
        cartActions.ts     # Cart actions
        orderActions.ts    # Order actions
      authSlice.ts         # Auth state management
      productSlice.ts      # Product state management
      cartSlice.ts         # Cart state management
      orderSlice.ts        # Order state management
      rootReducer.ts       # Root reducer
      index.ts             # Store configuration
```
