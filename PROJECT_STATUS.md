## 🚀 Ready to Run

The project is currently set up and ready to run in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

The basic structure is complete with:
- Navigation working between screens
- Redux store configured
- Authentication flow partially implemented
- Admin dashboard functional
- TypeScript types defined
- Basic components ready to use

## 💡 Development Tips

1. **Start with Customer Flow**: Complete the main shopping experience first
2. **Use Mock Data**: Implement screens with mock data before API integration
3. **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing common components
4. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript types for all new features
5. **Testing**: Add tests as you implement new features

The foundation is solid and ready for rapid development of remaining features!
