# React Native with Redux Persist - JSX Tag Fix

## Issue

The application was failing to bundle due to a syntax error in the JSX structure of `_layout.tsx`:

```
ERROR SyntaxError: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <PersistGate>
```

This occurred because we added the `<PersistGate>` component but forgot to include its closing tag.

## Fix Implemented

Added the missing closing tag for `<PersistGate>` component in the JSX hierarchy:

```jsx
// Before
<Provider store={store}>
  <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
    <NativeWindProvider>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <Stack>
          {/* ... */}
        </Stack>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </NativeWindProvider>
  </Provider> // Missing closing tag for PersistGate
</QueryClientProvider>

// After
<Provider store={store}>
  <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
    <NativeWindProvider>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <Stack>
          {/* ... */}
        </Stack>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </NativeWindProvider>
  </PersistGate> // Added closing tag
</Provider>
```

## Technical Details

The correct component nesting structure for Redux with Redux Persist is:

1. Provider (Redux)
2. PersistGate (Redux Persist)

# Order Confirmation Page JSX Fix

## Issue
The application was encountering bundling errors due to JSX structural issues in the order confirmation page. These issues were preventing the web bundler from properly processing the JSX code, resulting in errors like:

```
Web Bundling failed: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <div>
Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag
```

## Root Causes

1. **Mismatched JSX Tags**: There were unclosed or mismatched opening and closing tags in the JSX structure.
2. **Adjacent JSX Elements**: Multiple adjacent JSX elements were not properly wrapped in a parent element or fragment.
3. **Platform-Specific Component Issues**: The component was mixing React Native and web DOM elements in an inconsistent manner.
4. **TypeScript Type Errors**: The web styles were not properly typed, causing TypeScript to report errors for style properties.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. JSX Structure Reorganization
- Fixed the overall structure of the JSX in the order confirmation page
- Ensured all opening tags have matching closing tags
- Properly nested components within their parent containers

### 2. Fragment Wrapping
- Wrapped adjacent JSX elements in fragment tags (`<>...</>`) where needed
- Ensured proper parent-child relationships throughout the component structure

### 3. Platform-Specific Rendering
- Implemented proper conditional rendering for web and native platforms
- Separated the web and native rendering logic more clearly

### 4. TypeScript Type Improvements
- Added proper typing for web styles using `CSSProperties` type from React
- Used `Record<string, CSSProperties>` for the webStyles object to ensure type safety

### 5. Platform-Compatible Imports
- Implemented conditional imports for React Native components
- Created appropriate fallbacks for web environment

## Technical Details

### Conditional Import Pattern
```typescript
// Use conditional imports for platform compatibility
let View: any, Text: any, TouchableOpacity: any, StyleSheet: any, ScrollView: any;

// Import React Native components only in React Native environment
if (typeof window === 'undefined' || !('document' in window)) {
  // React Native environment
  const ReactNative = require('react-native');
  View = ReactNative.View;
  Text = ReactNative.Text;
  TouchableOpacity = ReactNative.TouchableOpacity;
  StyleSheet = ReactNative.StyleSheet;
  ScrollView = ReactNative.ScrollView;
} else {
  // Web environment - create stub components to keep TypeScript happy
  View = 'div';
  Text = 'span';
  TouchableOpacity = 'button';
  StyleSheet = {
    create: (styles: any) => styles
  };
  ScrollView = 'div';
}
```

### Web Styles Typing
```typescript
import type { CSSProperties } from 'react';

// Web styles as JavaScript object with proper typing
const webStyles: Record<string, CSSProperties> = {
  // style definitions...
};
```

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Consistent Component Usage**: Either use all React Native components or all web components within a single rendering section.
2. **Fragment Wrapping**: Always wrap adjacent JSX elements in a fragment (`<>...</>`) or container element.
3. **Platform Detection**: Use `typeof window !== 'undefined'` for safe platform detection.
4. **Proper TypeScript Types**: Define appropriate types for styles and props to catch issues early.
5. **Conditional Imports**: Use conditional imports for platform-specific code to maintain compatibility.
3. App Components

The PersistGate ensures that the Redux store has been rehydrated from persistent storage before rendering the app's components.

## Validation

After fixing the JSX structure, the application successfully bundles and starts without syntax errors.

## Best Practices

When adding wrapper components to your React/React Native application:
1. Always ensure proper nesting of opening and closing tags
2. Keep track of component hierarchy, especially with multiple provider components
3. When debugging JSX syntax errors, check for missing closing tags
4. Consider using an IDE with JSX bracket matching for visual validation
