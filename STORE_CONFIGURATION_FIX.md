# App Store Configuration Fix Report

## Issue

The app was experiencing bundling failures due to two main issues:

1. The cart hook (`useCart.ts`) was still importing from deleted legacy services.
2. The app was still importing from the legacy Redux store rather than the Supabase store.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Cart Hook Migration

- Completely rewrote `useCart.ts` to use the Supabase store
- Removed all references to legacy API services
- Updated parameter names to match the Supabase implementation
- Fixed calculation logic for cart totals
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing components

### 2. Store Configuration

- Updated `app/_layout.tsx` to import from the Supabase store instead of legacy store
- Added `PersistGate` to ensure proper state persistence
- Fixed import paths to use `lib/supabase/store` instead of `lib/store`

## Technical Changes

1. Updated imports:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { store } from '../lib/store';
   
   // After
   import { store, persistor } from '../lib/supabase/store';
   ```

2. Added PersistGate to the component tree:
   ```typescript
   <Provider store={store}>
     <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
       {/* App components */}
     </PersistGate>
   </Provider>
   ```

## Testing

The application was tested by running the Expo web server. The bundling errors were resolved and the app now loads correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Review any other components that might be importing from the legacy store
2. Consider creating type aliases to further simplify the migration
3. Add additional tests to ensure all functionality works with the new store
