# Daily Fresh Hosur - Migration Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to solve issues with the Supabase migration for the Daily Fresh Hosur app.

## 1. Cart Functionality Fixes

### Issue: "Add to Cart" Not Working
The cart functionality was broken because the `useCart` hook only worked for authenticated users and didn't handle guest users properly.

**Solution:**
- Modified the `useCart` hook to work for both authenticated and guest users
- Implemented local cart state management for guest users that doesn't require authentication
- Fixed the addItem, removeItem, updateItemQuantity, and clearAllItems functions to work with both authenticated and guest users
- Added "fake" redux dispatch actions to update the cart state for guest users

### Modified Files:
- `src/hooks/useCart.ts`

## 2. Authentication Session Initialization

### Issue: Session Not Being Initialized
The app wasn't checking for an existing authentication session on startup.

**Solution:**
- Created a new SessionInitializer component that checks for an active session on app launch
- Added the component to the app's _layout.tsx file

### Created Files:
- `src/components/auth/SessionInitializer.tsx`

### Modified Files:
- `app/_layout.tsx`

## 3. Cart Checkout Flow

### Issue: Checkout Only Worked for Authenticated Users
The checkout process required authentication, preventing guest users from checking out.

**Solution:**
- Modified the CartScreen to allow guest checkout
- Added an alert that gives users the option to sign in or continue as a guest
- Maintained the existing sign-in flow for users who want to authenticate

### Modified Files:
- `src/screens/cart/CartScreen.tsx`

## 4. Product List Scrolling Issues

### Issue: Product Lists in Category View Not Scrolling
The FlatList in the Category page had no height constraint, preventing proper scrolling.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped the FlatList in a View with flex: 1 to constrain its height and enable scrolling

### Modified Files:
- `app/category/[id].tsx`

## Compatibility Layer Approach

The implemented fixes follow a compatibility layer approach where we:

1. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
2. Add support for guest users while preserving authenticated user functionality
3. Allow the app to function even when authentication is not working properly
4. Provide a smooth transition path as the migration to Supabase continues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Supabase auth integration
2. Implement proper synchronization between local cart and server cart when users authenticate
3. Clean up duplicate cart hooks and standardize on a single implementation
4. Refactor the cart state management to use a more consistent approach
