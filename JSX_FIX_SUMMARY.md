# JSX Structure Fix Summary

## Problem
The order confirmation page had JSX structure errors preventing successful web bundling, with errors like:
- "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for `<div>`" 
- "Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"

## Changes Made
1. **Fixed JSX Structure** - Corrected mismatched and unclosed tags in the component hierarchy
2. **Added Fragment Wrappers** - Wrapped adjacent JSX elements in fragment tags (`<>...</>`)
3. **Improved Platform Detection** - Enhanced the conditional platform-specific rendering
4. **Added TypeScript Type Definitions** - Used proper typing with `CSSProperties` for web styles
5. **Implemented Dynamic Component Imports** - Created conditional imports for React Native components

## Results
- Resolved all bundling errors
- Fixed all TypeScript errors related to style properties
- Maintained consistent rendering on both web and native platforms
- Improved code maintainability with proper typing and structure

## Documentation Updates
- Updated JSX_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md with details about the structure fix
- Updated ORDER_CONFIRMATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md with cross-platform compatibility details

The application now successfully bundles and displays the order confirmation page correctly on both web and mobile platforms.
