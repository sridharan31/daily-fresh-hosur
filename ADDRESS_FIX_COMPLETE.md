# Address Submission Fix - Complete Report

## Issues Fixed
1. SyntaxError: `Identifier 'getAddressTitle' has already been declared` in addressUtils.ts
2. Mismatched field names between frontend Address and Supabase database schema
3. Improper handling of authentication in address operations
4. Potentially inefficient data mapping in checkout.tsx

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/utils/addressUtils.ts`
- Removed duplicate declarations of `getAddressType` and `getAddressTitle` functions
- Improved type definitions to match actual database schema
- Enhanced address mapping functionality

### 2. `lib/supabase/services/user.ts`
- Fixed imports to use the correct paths
- Updated `addAddress` function to:
  - Properly authenticate users
  - Use the `toSupabaseAddress` utility for data conversion
  - Apply proper user_id to all operations
- Enhanced `updateAddress` function with proper authentication and field mapping
- Updated `deleteAddress` and `setDefaultAddress` to use current user instead of passed userId

### 3. `app/checkout.tsx`
- Simplified `handleSaveAddress` function to leverage our improved userService
- Fixed address loading and mapping in the `loadAddresses` function

## Technical Details

### Field Mapping
Frontend Address schema:
```typescript
interface Address {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  pincode: string;
  type: 'home' | 'work' | 'other';
  landmark?: string;
  isDefault?: boolean;
}
```

Database schema:
```typescript
interface UserAddress {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  title: string;
  address_line_1: string;
  address_line_2: string | null;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  pincode: string;
  landmark: string | null;
  latitude: number | null;
  longitude: number | null;
  is_default: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Every address operation now first calls `await supabase.auth.getUser()`
2. Checks if a valid user exists before proceeding
3. Includes the user's ID in all database operations
4. Enforces security by adding `eq('user_id', user.id)` to all update/delete operations

### Default Address Handling
When an address is set as default:
1. First, all addresses for the user are set to `is_default: false`
2. Then, the target address is set to `is_default: true`

## Testing Instructions

To test the address functionality:

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the checkout page
3. Try adding a new address
4. Verify it appears in the list
5. Try selecting a different address as default
6. Verify the UI reflects the change

## Conclusion

The 403 error when submitting addresses should now be fixed. The application properly authenticates users before address operations, correctly maps address fields between frontend and database formats, and enforces Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase.
